# Solving rubik's cube without human knowledge


Warning: running one algorithm took as 10-20 hours.

Here's how to run:
!python CubeLib.py
!python constants.py
!python CubeModel.py
!python MCTS.py
!python ADI.py -newmodel default -greedy

!python Simulate_Greedy.py

!python Experiment_Greedy.py


(For a different algo, just run the simulate and experiment python file named after the algorithm)
